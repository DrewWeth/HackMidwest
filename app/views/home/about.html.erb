		<h1>about <%= BRAND_NAME %></h1>
		<h3>what is <%= BRAND_NAME %>?</h3>
		created in 2014 during HackMidwest by a few University of Missouri students, <%= BRAND_NAME %> is the solution to keeping track of reminding and tallying attendance to meetings, chapters, and other group events.
		
		<h3>is it free?</h3>
		yeah. for now. these texts cost money to send, so we'll eventually charge just for the overhead we're taking on now. we're considering a $10 monthly subscription.
		
		<h3>why via text?</h3>
		we want to use texting because it's universal and it's more personal, as these groups should be.
		
		<h3>why u no use capitals?</h3>
		you're reading this fine. ask yourself why we still need capitalized sentences.
		

		<h3>how safe is my data?</h3>
		few things here. (1) we don't see your data. (2) we don't sell your data. (3) your data is hidden behind a strong authentication process. and lastly (4) you're literally just a (phone) number to us, so it's very impersonal.
		
		<h3>who made this?</h3>
		5 dudes who go to Mizzou. see the team tab for more detail
