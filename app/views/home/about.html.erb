				<h3>what is it</h3>

				<h3>is it free?</h3>
			</div>
			<div class="col-sm-9" >
				yeah. for now. these texts cost money to send, so we'll eventually charge just for the overhead we're taking on now. we're considering a $10 monthly subscription.</div>

					<h3>why via text?</h3>
				</div>
				<div class="col-sm-9" >
				we want to use texting because it's universal and it's more personal, as these groups should be.

					<h3>why u no use capitals?</h3>

						<h3>how safe is my data?</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="col-sm-9" >
						few things here. (1) we don't see your data. (2) we don't sell your data. (3) your data is hidden behind a strong authentication process. and lastly (4) you're literally just a (phone) number to us, so it's very impersonal.
